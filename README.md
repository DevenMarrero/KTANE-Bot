![](https://media.playstation.com/is/image/SCEA/keep-talking-and-nobody-explodes-ps4-us-screen-04-13oct16?$MediaCarousel_Original$)

## Description
This is a Python bot built to act as the 'expert' and your defusal teammate for the game [Keep Tallking and Nobody Explodes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/)

For the unfamiliar, this is a 2+ player game where one player sits at a computer and describes a bomb only they can see to the experts. 
The experts must then quickly flip through their multi-page [manual](https://bombmanual.com/) and use the information provided to help the diffuser safely diffuse the bomb.

If there is more than one morse module make sure to reset morse

### Complex Wires

`complex wires <wires> - Wire attributes include (Red, Blue, Star, Light, None)`

Seperate wires with the word 'next' None/black is for wires with no attributes

### Maze

Coords start at upper left (1, 1) and go horizontally then vertically.

`maze <coords> - Where coords are 3 pairs of numbers for indicator, start, finish separated by 'next'`

Example:
